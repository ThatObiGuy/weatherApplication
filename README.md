## Overview

A web application that allows users to search for and receive weather information for various locations. This project serves as the second installment in my web development learning series, building upon the foundations established in the [Crystal Apple Pomodoro Timer](https://github.com/ThatObiGuy/pomodoroTimer).

## Features

- Location-based weather search functionality
- Display of current weather conditions
- User-friendly interface with responsive design
- Local JSON data source (with potential for API integration)

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5** - Application structure and form elements
- **CSS3** - Styling and responsive design
- **JavaScript** - Core functionality and data handling
- **JSON** - Local data storage and retrieval
- **VS Code Live Server** - Local development environment

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- VSCode with Live Server extension (for local development)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ThatObiGuy/weatherApplication.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd weatherApplication
   ```

3. Open the project in VSCode and run using Live Server extension

## How to Use

1. Open the application in your browser
2. Enter a location in the search field
3. View the displayed weather information for the selected location

## Development Notes

This project features:
- Local JSON data structure that simulates weather API responses
- VS Code's Live Server extension for local development
- Extensive use of console.log() for debugging and development
- Responsive design principles for multiple device compatibility

## Learning Outcomes

Through building this application, I:
- Gained experience working with JSON data structures
- Learned to use VS Code's Live Server extension for local development
- Improved JavaScript debugging skills using console.log()
- Enhanced understanding of user input processing and data display

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Integration with a live weather API for real-time data
- [ ] Extended forecast functionality (multi-day predictions)
- [ ] Geolocation support for automatic location detection
- [ ] Weather alerts and notifications
- [ ] Data visualization with charts and graphs
- [ ] Database integration for user preferences and history

## Project Series Context

This weather application is the second installment in my web development learning series:
1. [Crystal Apple Pomodoro Timer](https://github.com/ThatObiGuy/pomodoroTimer) - HTML, CSS, and JavaScript basics
2. **Weather Application** - JSON data handling and CORS implementation
3. *Coming Soon* - Database integration and advanced features

## Acknowledgments

- Built by [ThatObiGuy](https://github.com/ThatObiGuy)
- Special thanks to the VSCode Live Server extension for local development support - I had not yet the time to discover how else to by-pass CORS errors
